Lab 1
Writing both quick sort and merge sort in C was very tedious. Compared to Haskell, C does not allow and shortcuts by using any abstractions to compare the elements. In Haskell, we were able to use the Ord class and the rest of the program was pretty much done. Haskell is a fully functional program so algorithms such as quick sort and merge sort are a lot simpler to write compared to C.
